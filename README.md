# My Phenomenal Professional Portfolio

## Description

This website was built to showcase my work and the skills I have learned to potential employers. The code was made with a responsive design and optimized for accessability. I learned how to use flexbox and media queries to make the website accessible to devices with different screen sizes.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the website, click on the link in the navigation bar (About Me, Work, or Contact Me) to scroll automatically to the corresponding section. In the Work section, if you hover over the boxes, they will get a shadow when you hover over them. If you click them you will be brought to the corresponding application in the future when I have applications deployed. In the contact me section, if you click the link you will be brought to the corresponding way of contacting me. If you go to Inspect by typing Command+Option+I (Mac OS) or CTRL+Shift+I (Windows) and resize the screen using the Toggle Device Toolbar, You will see that the site accomodates smaller screen sizes.
