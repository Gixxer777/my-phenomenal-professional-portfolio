        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a Entry Level Web Developer with a background in sales and the hostpitality industry. I am always up for a challenge 
            and if you give me a problem, I will solve it. I have a can-do attitude and take the inevitable mistakes that arise and turn them into a learning experience.
            My background in sales and the hospitality industry has ingrained in me the the habit of making sure the customer's expectations are met and they leave an
            interaction with me wanting to come back to me again. I am very adaptable, goal-driven, and I am a quick learner. I strive to 
            always complete any project I start with professionalism and attention to detail.
